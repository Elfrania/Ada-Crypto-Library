Welcome to the ADA Crypto Library (ACL) aka libadacrypt-0.4.x
=============================================================

About ACL:
---------
This library is an ongoing project with the goal
to provide "strong" and clean coded cryptography
library for Ada.

Note, that depending on where you are, the use of cryptography may be
limited or forbidden by law. Before using this library, make sure you
are legally entitled to do so.


Implemented Features
---------------------
 -- Symmetric Cryptography
   - Blockciphers: AES, Twofish, 3DES, Serpent
   - Modes of Operation : BPS, CFB, Ctr, OFB 
   - Tweakable Blockcipher Modes:  CMT, XT
   - Hash functions: SHA-1 (broken), SHA-256, (SHA-384), SHA-512, Whirlpool
   - MACs: RMAC, HMAC, CMAC
   - Authenticated Encryption schemes: OCB, SIV and McOE

-- Big (unsigned) number library
